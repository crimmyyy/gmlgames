# A LOT
of these games were coded when I was super young. Please don't take them all too seriously. These are here for archiving purposes **ONLY**.

Most of my games still remain lost media to this day, so if anybody wants to go out and find them, send me a private message and I might possibly give you a cash reward.

Cheers.
